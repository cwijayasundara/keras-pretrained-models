# keras-pretrained-models
This repo contains re training pre trained Resnet50 and Vgg16 models for my own data and used that for predictions

These models take a long time to train and I could only do this using Google colab env with GPUs. TPUs are much faster 
but did not try.

Colab recycle its VMs every now and then so your generated models will get wiped out so you need to couple your Colab env
with your Google drive for example.

Google drive can be mounted to your Colab env quite easily.

Ones its mounted, you can access your data, models from your Google drive.

This is how I did this.
